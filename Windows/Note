In order for colors to work while running the python file, make sure to navigate to the directory of the file and run python3 Sk3llyB0nes.py instead of just double clikcking it

IMPORTANT: In order for netcat to work, drag nc.exe from your netcat install folder into the same folder as sk3llyb0nes.py
