# Sk3llyB0nes
[WIP] hacking framework
Im creating Sk3llyB0nes to help automate things while i do penetration testing/ctfs. Currently there is only a Reverse shell feature, but i am going to add port scanning, directory bruteforce, password/service bruteforce, and (just an idea now) maybe some kind of feature that pulls exploits from exploit database. Idk im still learning cybersecurity and programming so this is mostly for fun, experience, and to automate some things

special thanks to: thenewboston for initial reverse shell code. You taught me alot man
