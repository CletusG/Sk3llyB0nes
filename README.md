# Sk3llyB0nes
[WIP] hacking framework
Im creating Sk3llyB0nes to help automate things while i do penetration testing/ctfs. Currently there is only a Reverse shell feature, but i am going to add port scanning, directory bruteforce, password/service bruteforce, and (just an idea now) maybe some kind of feature that pulls exploits from exploit database. Idk im still learning cybersecurity and programming so this is mostly for fun, experience, and to automate some things

NOTE: iOS (and windows) are seperate because of notification modules. Ill try to find a notification module that works for linux and windows(and maybe even iOS)
the reason is because i use notify2 which uses dbus which you cant get on windows or iOS for that matter. Im running this script on iSH on my iphone (beta app. Ive installed pip and everything succesfully): https://ish.app/

thanks to: thenewboston for initial reverse shell code. You taught me alot
